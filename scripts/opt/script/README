DMR SUDO Reflector - TG  





This is the first release version of the relinker scripts 3.2 






These scripts are supplied as is and work in conjuction with DMRGateway Mid April 2020 Onwards .....If you don't understand the notes ask someone who does please     

Tested on rasp pi running MMDVMHost and DMRGateway Using SUDO-Reflector-TalkGroups 


These scripts provide a means to setup via the config file default TG's for each slot on a repeater. These should be also setup as only Static TG setup via Brandmeister Selfcare, so that when 
a slot is commanded to another dynamic TG by a user and then after use they forget to unlink. The BM Dynamic TG timer which is monitored by this script (expires 10 minutes after inactivity) 
the slot will be returned to the configured Static default TG.

Both slots can be monitored together and as they maybe taken off to other dynamics at the same time or individually it is worth getting users in the habit of sending a PC 4000 once they finish    
using a different TG as it ensures the repeater when not in use is in the correct place for most of the time.       


A default TG of choice which can be configured linking provided on on both slots. 



Installation 

Firstly DMRGateway should have the following lines minimum configuring if running both timeslots for SUDO Reflector on a repeater  


# Dynamic rewriting of slot 2 TGs 90-999999 to TG9 to emulate reflector behaviour Private call manual dial commands  PC 2351 for SUDO REF TG 2351 PC 4000 unlink PC 5000 Status PC 9990 echo BM     


TGDynRewrite0=1,90,4000,5000,9,999910,9990
TGDynRewrite1=2,90,4000,5000,9,999910,9990

Check you also have the following section added in your DMRGateway config file its usually at the bottom

[Dynamic TG Control]
Enabled=1
Port=3769




1.  Copy the package DMRGateway-TGDynRewrite-relinker-3.2.tgz to the folder/boot  and also the install-relinker.sh script supplied (you can do this with a card reader from windows if you like) 


2.  run /boot#./install-relinker     which should create folders /opt/script/script  and /var/log/script/various working files and logfile. it also sets up services in systemd 

ready to run the script required

       

3. Edit the config file /opt/script/script.conf repeater=235??? ID  call callsign your defaults for slot linking   

also min relink timer minrelinktimer in seconds this is the time before reconnection on a slot after someone finishes RF and either the slot is unlinked by the user 

or the dynamic times out i.e BM timer 

it waits a further minlinktimer seconds before relinking 

slowdown=10   This is higher for faster rasp pi 10 for  pi 3B +  or 1  for original Pi B   

checkslot1=check_status_slot1
checkslot2=check_status_slot2
slot1notlinked=check_if_nothing_linked_slot1  
slot2notlinked=check_if_nothing_linked_slot2

Above checks all slots default for repeater with prefered config SUDO Reflectors both slots ............if in doubt include all these lines !!!!

 
checkslot1=
checkslot2=check_status_slot2
slot1notlinked=   
slot2notlinked=check_if_nothing_linked_slot2

Above checks only slot 2 typically a hotspot........ or a repeater that only has SUDO Reflectors enabled in DMRGateway on one of the slots 
 

............if in doubt include all these lines in first example!!!!




4. Don't forget to set these static via Brandmeister selfcare
 


5. Add the following line to crontab on the rasp pi you dont need to do anything else just save crontab and exit 

17 *	* * *	root    echo -n "" > /var/log/script/checkBMAPI.log






6. Pi-star additional step


Also in same file etc/rc.local 

look for 

if [ ! -d /var/log/unattended-upgrades ]; then
	mkdir -p /var/log/unattended-upgrades




fi

add only the below lines just below the above block 

if [ ! -d /var/log/script ]; then
	/opt/script/./start.sh
fi
 

7. start one of the services with following command


choose either Repeater 

systemctl start relinker.service



or Hotspot ?

systemctl start relinkerhot.service


systemctl status relinker.service     

or 

systemctl status relinkerhot.service


will show if its running if it is running ?  


you can tail the log file at the command prompt 


tail -f /var/log/script/checkBMAPI.log


once it is confirmed running and working 


enable the service you chose to enable automatically at boot example 

systemctl enable relinker.service 

for repeater 

or

systemctl enable relinkerhot.service

for hotspot


reboot 


once you have rebooted check all is auto starting 


you can tail the log file at the command prompt 


tail -f /var/log/script/checkBMAPI.log









Have fun
